                -- Installation --

Installation works through the Mix build tool shipped with Elixir and the
GNU Make program.

The makefile has a number of targets for building and testing Flect:

* all: Runs deps, ebin, and escript. This is the default target.
* deps: Fetches and builds all dependencies.
* ebin: Builds all Flect modules. Runs deps if needed.
* escript: Builds the escriptized Flect binary. Runs ebin if needed.
* test: Runs the compiler test suite. Runs ebin if needed.
  Runs ebin if needed.
* update: Updates all dependencies to their latest versions from Git. Runs deps
  if needed.
* dialyze: Runs Dialyzer on compiled Flect modules. Runs ebin if needed.
* clean: Cleans up the tree (removes compiled modules, dependencies, dump
  files, etc).

When running the ebin target (whether directly or implicitly) you should make
sure that your environment is configured correctly. A number of variables need
to be set so that Flect knows what kind of target to compile for:

* FLECT_CC
* FLECT_CC_TYPE
* FLECT_OS
* FLECT_ENV
* FLECT_ARCH
* FLECT_BITS
* FLECT_ABI

See the COMPATIBILITY file for possible values.

To get an escript:

    $ make escript

This places the escript named flect in the root of the source tree. It is
completely self-contained so it can be moved anywhere and will run fine
provided the host system it is run on has Erlang and Elixir installed.

It's a good idea to run the test suite before using the compiler:

    $ make test
